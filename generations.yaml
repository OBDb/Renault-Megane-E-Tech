    description: "The Renault Megane E-Tech Electric represents Renault's first purpose-built electric vehicle based on the Alliance CMF-EV platform dedicated to electric vehicles, marking a significant evolution of the Megane nameplate into the EV era. Despite carrying the Megane name, the E-Tech Electric features a completely distinct crossover-inspired design with a higher stance than traditional Megane models but a relatively low height (1.50m) for an electric crossover, prioritizing aerodynamic efficiency. The exterior design, developed under Gilles Vidal, features distinctive full-LED lighting including Renault's new light signature, flush door handles that deploy automatically, and a contrasting roof. Available with two battery options—a 40 kWh pack providing approximately 186 miles of range and a 60 kWh pack offering up to 292 miles (WLTP)—paired with electric motors producing either 130 or 218 horsepower, with the more powerful version delivering 0-62 mph acceleration in 7.4 seconds. The interior represents Renault's most advanced cabin design to date, centered around the new OpenR display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument panel and 12-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen powered by Google's Android Automotive OS with built-in Google services. This system incorporates over 40 apps and can receive over-the-air updates. The cabin emphasizes sustainability with extensive use of recycled materials, while clever packaging of the battery (just 11cm thick) enables a spacious interior despite compact exterior dimensions. Advanced driver assistance systems include level 2 autonomous driving capability, automatic emergency braking, rear cross-traffic alert, and a 3D surround-view camera. Charging capabilities include up to 130 kW DC fast charging, allowing for up to 186 miles of range to be added in 30 minutes. The Megane E-Tech Electric represents Renault's significant investment in electrification as part of its 'Renaulution' strategy, offering a modern, technology-focused alternative to both traditional compact cars and larger electric SUVs."
